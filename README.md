# Polynomial-Regression

Lets Talk About Polynomial Regression:

Polynomial regression is a form of linear regression in which the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial function. Unlike simple linear regression, which assumes a linear relationship, polynomial regression can capture nonlinear relationships between variables. It allows for curved or nonlinear patterns in the data to be represented by adding polynomial terms, such as squared or cubed variables, to the regression equation. Polynomial regression can provide a more flexible and accurate fit to the data, especially when the relationship between the variables is not strictly linear. However, higher-degree polynomial models can also be prone to overfitting, so careful model selection and validation are important. Polynomial regression is commonly used in various fields, including physics, economics, and social sciences, to model complex relationships and make predictions beyond simple linear trends.
